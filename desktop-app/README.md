# Audio Listener AI - Desktop Application

This is a desktop application built with Electron and TypeScript, providing the functionality of the Audio Listener AI web application.

## Features

- Listens to user audio input.
- Sends audio to a backend API for transcription and AI processing.
- Displays the transcribed question and the AI-generated answer.
- Supports multiple languages (English and Vietnamese).
- Allows selection of different question contexts (e.g., Frontend Development, React.js).
- Supports custom context instructions for the AI.
- Provides options to retry transcription or process directly with Gemini AI.
- Includes a history feature to view and manage past questions and answers.
- Supports follow-up questions based on the previous interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- The backend API server must be running and accessible.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you are in the `desktop-app` directory.**

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API URL:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the `desktop-app` directory.
    - Add the following line, replacing the URL with your actual backend API server address:
      ```
      API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3033
      ```

4.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command will first compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript (outputting to the `dist` directory) and then launch the Electron application.

## Development

- **Build TypeScript:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This compiles the TypeScript files in `src` to JavaScript in `dist`.

- **Run Electron:**
  ```bash
  electron .
  ```
  (Make sure you have run `npm run build` first)

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source code for the main process (`main.ts`), preload script (`preload.ts`), and the renderer process (HTML, CSS, JS).
  - `src/js/`: Contains the frontend JavaScript modules.
  - `src/index.html`: The main HTML file for the renderer process.
  - `src/style.css`: The CSS styles for the application.
  - `src/main.ts`: Electron main process entry point.
  - `src/preload.ts`: Electron preload script for secure API exposure.
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript output from TypeScript. (Generated by `npm run build`)
- `.env`: Environment variables (contains API_BASE_URL). **Do not commit this file to version control if it contains sensitive information.**
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
- `README.md`: This file.
